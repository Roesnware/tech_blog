## Description
    
    I want to create an app that lets me voice my thoughts and ahah moments to about tech to other nerds like me!
    Tech geeks are allowed to post blog post, see other peoples blogs, and leave comments on blogs. I learned MVC file structure and strengthened knowledge of back-end.
